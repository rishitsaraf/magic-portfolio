# Why Asset-Light Procurement Will Beat Heavy B2B Marketplaces

## Introduction

The world of B2B commerce is at a crossroads. In one corner, we have inventory-heavy marketplace models – platforms that buy, hold, and sell stock (the "1P" first-party model) to control supply. In the other, emerging asset-light procurement networks that connect businesses without owning inventory. Recent trends suggest the asset-light approach is pulling ahead, especially in India. Investors and analysts are pivoting towards capital-efficient models that can scale without burning cash on warehouses and inventory.

The contrast is stark: Udaan – once India's poster child for B2B e-commerce – saw its valuation plunge from a $3.2 billion peak in 2021 to about $1.8 billion by 2023 amid a market correction and investor caution. Meanwhile, asset-light players like IndiaMART, a purely digital marketplace, boast hefty profit margins and free cash flow.

In this blog, we'll explore why the asset-light digital procurement model is poised to beat out heavy B2B marketplaces, with a focus on India's market (and a glance at global parallels).

B2B marketplaces in India are projected to represent a ~$200 billion opportunity by 2030 (5% of the overall B2B trade), reflecting immense room for growth as more businesses shift procurement online.

## The Problem with Inventory-Heavy B2B Marketplaces

Traditional B2B marketplaces often followed the playbook of B2C e-commerce: purchase goods from suppliers, stock them in warehouses, and sell to buyers. This inventory-heavy model offers control over quality and delivery, but at a steep cost. It ties up significant capital in stock and logistics infrastructure, and leaves the platform carrying thin margins and high risk if demand forecasts go wrong.

Udaan's journey illustrates these pitfalls vividly. The company's 1P model (buying goods and reselling to Kirana stores) led to major expenses – procurement of goods was its single largest cost, comprising over 75% of total costs in FY24. Even after aggressive cost-cutting (slashing employee and logistics expenses by 17–39%), Udaan still spent ₹1.3 to earn each rupee of revenue and ended FY24 with a net loss of ₹1,674 crore (≈$200 mn). Its gross merchandise value has stagnated, and investors punished the cash burn with a 59% valuation markdown to ~$1.3 billion by late 2023.

In short, an inventory-led approach can "buy" growth for a while, but converting that to profitability is a whole different ballgame.

India's Udaan, once a high-flying B2B unicorn, had to restructure its inventory-heavy operations as losses mounted. Its valuation tumbled ~44% from $3.2 B to $1.8 B amid a push for profitability.

Beyond financial strain, heavy B2B marketplaces face operational complexity. They must manage warehousing, fulfillment, and often extend credit to buyers – essentially behaving like traditional distributors on steroids. This "full-stack" control can improve customer experience, but it erodes the marketplace's economic advantage.

For example, Amazon's B2B arm (Amazon Business) inherits the heavy infrastructure of Amazon's retail business, which compresses margins. In contrast, China's Alibaba operates as a pure platform, connecting buyers and sellers without holding stock, and it shows – Alibaba's marketplace model is far more capital-light and highly profitable, whereas Amazon's own retail operations run on razor-thin margins (offset only by lucrative side businesses like AWS).

As a Boston Consulting Group study noted, asset-heavy, vertically integrated models offer control, but they tie up capital and are less flexible in a fast-changing environment. We've certainly seen that in B2B: owning the supply chain end-to-end might ensure product availability or quality, but it comes at the cost of agility and financial efficiency. And when investor sentiment shifts from "growth-at-all-cost" to "show me the profits," the asset-heavy ventures find themselves in a tough spot.

## The Asset-Light Procurement Advantage (SaaS-Enabled Marketplaces)

What exactly do we mean by "asset-light procurement"? In essence, these are digital platforms that facilitate B2B transactions without owning inventory, often supplementing the marketplace with software services. Think of it as a SaaS × Marketplace hybrid: the platform provides software tools to manufacturers, suppliers, or retailers (for cataloging, ordering, payments, etc.) and simultaneously enables those parties to trade with each other online.

The platform monetizes via subscription fees or transaction commissions rather than product mark-ups, and it doesn't buy goods for resale. This model drastically reduces the need for working capital – no massive warehouses full of goods, no capital locked in unsold inventory. Instead, the focus is on technology, data, and network-building.

Asset-light marketplaces make money from things they don't own or fully control by facilitating introduction and payments between supply and demand. They can thus scale faster and more efficiently than inventory-heavy peers, because growth doesn't require proportionate capital investment in physical assets.

A prime example is IndiaMART InterMESH, India's largest online B2B marketplace. IndiaMART operates purely as a matchmaking platform for SMEs – suppliers list their products, buyers post requirements, and the platform connects them (largely as a directory and lead-generation service). Crucially, IndiaMART carries no inventory and doesn't meddle in the actual fulfillment.

Instead, it earns through subscriptions: suppliers pay for premium listing tiers to get better visibility and more leads. The result? Extremely healthy economics. IndiaMART enjoys negative working capital (customers pay in advance) and a fixed-asset-light setup; in fact, it's one of those rare businesses whose free cash flow exceeds reported profits.

As of FY25, IndiaMART commanded ~60% of India's B2B e-commerce market and was growing revenue ~16% annually with nearly 40% EBITDA margins. Such margins are way higher than asset-heavy peers – "hovering close to 40%, which is far healthier than peers like Infra.Market or Udaan," as noted in one analysis.

This profit profile is a direct outcome of an asset-light model: IndiaMART's core marketplace has an infinite ROI on capital because the company doesn't sink money into warehouses or stock – it simply takes a cut (or fee) on digital transactions and listings. The network effects are strong too: more buyers attract more sellers, whose subscription fees fund IndiaMART's tech and sales teams, which in turn bring more buyers – a virtuous cycle.

Once such a platform hits critical mass, it's extremely hard for a new entrant to replicate the network without spending a fortune. The asset-light model thus not only boosts profitability but can yield winner-takes-all dynamics in each niche.

Another case study in capital-efficient B2B is Bizongo, an Indian B2B procurement startup in the packaging materials sector. Bizongo took a vertical-focused approach (packaging, textiles, etc.), acting as a cloud-based supply chain solution for enterprises. It provides SaaS portals for vendors (Procure Live, Partner Hub) to digitize their supply chain, while enabling transactions between product manufacturers and enterprise buyers.

Bizongo deliberately kept an "asset-light operating model" – it doesn't run huge factories or hold tons of inventory, instead it coordinates orders and production with a network of 3,000+ partner factories. This approach impressed investors: Tiger Global's partner John Curtius noted that "the full-stack approach with an asset-light operating model makes Bizongo stand out as a market leader".

In practice, Bizongo's platform assures 100% availability of packaging SKUs for clients at very low inventory levels by syncing demand with its supplier network in real-time. It even launched a "cloud factory" IoT solution to monitor third-party production remotely – rather than owning the plant, Bizongo's tech can ensure quality and timelines.

The outcome is a scalable model where growth is powered by technology and partnerships, not piles of physical stock. Indeed, Bizongo reportedly reached ₹1,100+ crore (~$150 mn) annual revenue and turned cash-flow positive by 2022, all while remaining asset-light.

The SaaS-enabled marketplace hybrid is powerful because it solves the chicken-and-egg problem in B2B networks. By offering valuable software to one side of the market, you can attract and lock-in users even before the network effects fully kick in.

For instance, a procurement platform might give manufacturers a free inventory management tool (SaaS), which they use for their own operations; once a critical mass of manufacturers is on board, the platform can introduce a marketplace where those manufacturers can sell to buyers already using the system. This way, the SaaS functionality drives user acquisition and retention, while the marketplace layer drives monetization when transactions happen.

We've seen similar playbooks in Western markets – companies like Zenefits in HR (free HR SaaS + upsell insurance marketplace) or Segment.com's integrations marketplace – and now Indian startups are applying it to B2B trade.

The vertical-first go-to-market (GTM) strategy also adds to scalability. By focusing on one sector's supply chain deeply (be it packaging, agriculture, chemicals, etc.), asset-light platforms can tailor their software to that industry's needs and build a defensible position. Once they dominate one vertical with healthy unit economics, they can expand to adjacent categories or geographies.

Heavy marketplaces like Udaan tried to tackle many categories (FMCG, pharma, food, electronics) at once, which meant heavy capital outlay across the board. In contrast, an asset-light player can win one segment at a time with relatively lean operations.

This vertical focus is evident in success stories: IndiaMART initially thrived in directories for exporters before expanding domestically; Bizongo started with packaging; US-based Faire focused on boutique retail wholesale, etc. It's a land-and-expand approach that dovetails well with a light model.

## Investors Pivot to Profitability and Efficiency

The shift in investor sentiment post-2022 cannot be overstated. The exuberance of 2021's funding boom (cheap capital chasing growth) gave way to a sobering funding winter in 2023, where venture capital flows shrank dramatically and performance expectations rose.

Simply put, the market flipped from valuing topline-at-any-cost to demanding clear paths to profitability and sustainable unit economics. In this climate, startups with lean, asset-light operations have a compelling narrative. They can pitch faster break-even, high gross margins, and low capex needs – music to investors' ears when capital is scarce.

Conversely, inventory-led models that once commanded sky-high valuations are now getting re-rated due to their cash guzzling nature. We saw this with Udaan's flat/down rounds: despite reaching ~$1 billion in annual GMV, Udaan had to raise capital at ~$1.8 B valuation in 2023–25 (nearly half its peak) because investors were no longer willing to fund huge burns for growth.

As one report noted, "reducing losses without growth is hardly a recipe that will please investors… thin margins mean that investor-funded growth and scale are possible, but converting that to actual profitability is another ballgame". That statement encapsulates why the heavy model is losing favor – it might buy market share, but it struggles to translate to the bottom line, which is what today's VCs and PE firms are zeroing in on.

On the flip side, asset-light procurement startups align perfectly with the post-2024 investment thesis of capital efficiency. They often have software-like financial profiles – recurring revenues, high gross margins (since they take a fee on transactions or charge for SaaS), and limited need for physical expansion.

Many also have the advantage of generating ancillary revenue streams like payments or financing without asset ownership. For example, a marketplace can partner with a fintech to offer credit to buyers (earning a cut) instead of extending its own balance sheet. This further improves ROI and keeps operations lean.

It's no surprise that funding is gravitating to such models. Globally, we see strong investor interest in "marketplace 3.0" companies and SaaS-enabled marketplaces. Mirakl, a French SaaS that enables retailers to launch third-party marketplaces, became a unicorn by selling shovels in this gold rush (providing the tech backbone for asset-light commerce).

In India, venture firms like Bessemer, Accel, and Lightspeed have been actively backing B2B marketplace plays that emphasize light models and fintech or SaaS integrations (from Infra.Market's earlier rounds to newer vertical marketplaces).

The timing is perfect: as the graphic above showed, B2B online commerce in India is barely ~1% penetrated in 2022, projected to rise to only ~5% by 2030. That means the next decade will witness an explosion of digital procurement adoption. Investors know that whoever captures this growth with the right model stands to build the next big platform.

And given the lessons of the past few years, "the right model" will be the one that can scale sustainably, not just rapidly.

It's worth noting that asset-light doesn't automatically mean success – these companies must still solve the fundamental trust and fragmentation issues in B2B. In sectors where quality control or consistency is a big challenge, some degree of heavy involvement (warehousing, QC centers, etc.) may be needed.

But even here, we see innovation favoring light approaches: for instance, instead of buying and refurbishing used goods themselves, some platforms use verification partners or IoT monitoring (as Bizongo did with cloud factory IoT) to ensure standards without ownership.

The trend, therefore, is that technology is replacing what capital used to do. Where a heavy marketplace would spend on assets to guarantee reliability, an asset-light one spends on data and software to achieve the outcome. This is inherently more scalable once the tech is proven.

And scalability with minimal incremental cost is exactly what drives venture-style returns – hence the investor enthusiasm.

## A Glance at the Global Perspective

While our focus is India, it's enlightening to compare with global B2B commerce trends. The Alibaba vs Amazon example cited earlier is perhaps the clearest illustration of asset-light vs asset-heavy in online marketplaces.

Alibaba built a $600+ billion empire (market cap) largely on an asset-light marketplace that charges fees to sellers and advertisers, without taking on the burden of inventory or a vast owned delivery fleet. Amazon, by contrast, chose a hybrid model – it runs a 1P retail business alongside a 3P marketplace.

The outcome? Alibaba's core commerce margins are north of 30%, whereas Amazon's retail division operates at low single-digit margins (relying on AWS to prop up profitability). In fact, Alibaba's logistics arm Cainiao is also asset-light, orchestrating third-party couriers rather than owning all delivery trucks.

This has allowed Alibaba to remain extremely capital-efficient and focus on platform innovation. It's a validation that in the long run, platform businesses (when feasible) tend to out-return pipeline businesses – or as one analogy puts it, pipes vs platforms: pipes (asset-heavy "push" models) can be powerful but often yield lower returns on assets, whereas platforms (asset-light network models) can achieve exponential scale with limited assets.

Another global angle is how post-2022 market conditions have universally favored profitability. In the US and Europe, we saw high-profile write-downs of once-lauded marketplace startups that were too asset-heavy or cash-intensive (e.g. fast grocery delivery startups, some of which shut down or consolidated).

In contrast, companies championing capital discipline became investor darlings. The public markets also mirror this in valuations: for example, IndiaMART (NSE: INDIAMART) which is profitable and asset-light, trades at rich earnings multiples, whereas many loss-making e-commerce players are struggling to justify their valuations.

This divergence creates a strong incentive for new B2B ventures globally to adopt asset-light strategies – it's easier to raise money and eventually go public if you can show strong unit economics early on. As an investor quipped, "Asset-light marketplaces were celebrated as the most valuable form of marketplace ever" during the Uber/Airbnb era – now that sentiment is back, albeit tempered with the wisdom that one should still choose the model that fits the use-case.

## Conclusion

As India's B2B sector comes online and small manufacturers and retailers embrace digital procurement, the stakes (and opportunities) are enormous. But the playbook for success has fundamentally changed from a few years ago.

Asset-light procurement platforms – those that leverage technology and partnerships to enable trade without owning the trade – are emerging as the winners. They are more capital-efficient, scaling up users and revenue with far less cash burn, and they achieve profitability faster by keeping operating costs low.

In a market where investors have become laser-focused on sustainable growth, this makes all the difference. We've seen how heavy marketplace champions like Udaan had to course-correct to survive, while lighter models like IndiaMART steadily mint cash and dominate their space.

This is not to say there's no room for hybrid approaches (some sectors may need a mix of physical and digital enablement), but even those hybrids are now expected to demonstrate "path to profit" early and keep the asset ownership to a minimum necessary.

For analysts, investors, and the millions of SME manufacturers and businesses in India, this shift is encouraging. It points to a future where B2B commerce is platform-driven and efficient, rather than bogged down by the high costs of traditional distribution.

An asset-light digital procurement platform can empower SMEs with wide market access and SaaS tools without charging them an arm and a leg – because the platform doesn't have to factor in heavy operating costs. That virtuous alignment of platform and participant success is perhaps the ultimate reason asset-light will win: the model naturally creates a win-win ecosystem.

Suppliers get more of the value, buyers get transparency and choice, and the platform makes a tidy margin for making the match. And as the post-2024 venture market signals, "lean is the new scale".

Asset-light procurement isn't just a buzzword – it's shaping up to be the foundation of the next era of B2B marketplaces, in India and beyond. Those who master this model stand to ride the huge wave of B2B digitization on a sturdy, sustainable surfboard, while the asset-heavy players may find that wave washing over heavy ships that can no longer stay afloat.
