## Overview

This project focuses on developing a video content authenticity detection system using Euler Video Magnification (EVM). The model detects whether a face in a video is real or fake by magnifying subtle physiological signals, such as heartbeat, and analyzing the frames through machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Euler Video Magnification (EVM)**: Used to amplify subtle color variations in facial regions, which correspond to heartbeat signals.
- **Frame Processing Pipeline**:
  - Frame extraction
  - Landmark detection and facial region cropping using `dlib`
  - Video stitching from processed frames
- **Signal Analysis**: Performed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the Region of Interest (ROI) to extract frequency-domain features.
- **Deep Learning Classification**: The final pipeline aims to classify videos as ‚ÄúPristine‚Äù or ‚ÄúFake‚Äù using an LSTM-based classifier (in-progress).
- **Collaboration & Research**: Developed as part of a research initiative at Ben-Gurion University‚Äôs Summer Programme.

## Technologies Used

- **Libraries**: NumPy, OpenCV (`cv2`), dlib, TensorFlow, matplotlib, skimage, Pandas, PIL
- **Video Processing**: FFT, EVM
- **Machine Learning**: LSTM (planned), signal processing techniques

## Roadmap

- ‚úÖ Dataset Identification and Balancing
- ‚úÖ Preprocessing Pipeline for Frame Extraction and Cropping
- ‚úÖ Euler Video Magnification Implementation
- ‚¨ú LSTM-Based Classification Model
- ‚¨ú Automated End-to-End Pipeline
- ‚¨ú Deployment of Detection System
